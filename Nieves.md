Nieves et al. was able to predict an estimate of the population density through the random forest model. The random forest is a machine-learning model that works through using ensemble methods. These methods use inputted covariates to create decision trees which are weak learners and combine them into strong learners which are better able to predict the population distrubtion. In addition, it has three main steps. The first is to select the pertinent covariates for a region or area. The second is to fit the random forest model to avaible census data and create a population density weighting layer. Then, in the final step, there is a dasymetric redistribution of population through the use of administrative units. A dasymmetric population allocation is when population data associated with geographical data is represented through a map with different colors or other symbols to represent the differences of population density. Lastly, the conclusion of the research was that the most important covariates for predicting human population density were urban/suburban extents, built enviornments, urban/suburban proxies, enviornmental variables, populated place covariates, and transportation networks.
