In terms of pitfalls, there have been various instances where the aid that was meant for the poor has instead empowered wealthier families. This is due to digital credit and other factors that contribute to the raw data collection necesitating certain factors that those who are wealthier are more likely to have such as a phone or facebook account.

Finally, by committing more resources to developing countries, the people developing these models will be able to better understand the context of the population which can then be used to create better models.

In terms of transparency, due to this data being used for such an important effort transparecnt
