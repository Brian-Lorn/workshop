# Response to Blumenstock

In terms of pitfalls, there have been various instances where the aid that was meant for the poor has instead empowered wealthier families. This is due to digital credit and other factors that contribute to the raw data collection necessitating certain factors that those who are wealthier are more likely to have such as a phone or Facebook account. In addition, these attempts to map out population by wealth has not been thoroughly tested, meaning that the modeling could be incorrectly representing the population of a developing country. Lastly, those who are wealthier but desire aid might attempt to cheat the system in order to receive benefits intended for other families.

However, Blumenstock suggests that some of these pitfalls can be avoided. For example, to avoid misappropriating resources, the modeling from the data can be customized to better fit the population it is meant to represent. Additionally, the modeling from data collection can be supplemented from on site, house-to-house surveying. This will be able to avoid the issue of misrepresenting a certain country's population by necessitating certain factors found in more wealthier families as a prerequisite. Finally, by committing more resources to developing countries, the people developing these models will be able to better understand the context of the population which can then be used to create better models.

Regarding the intersection between human development and data science, it is paramount to not only intend to do well but have tangible, clear goals towards making progress. Due to the dire consequences of misallocating resources to those who need it, good intent is not enough assurance. Thus, having goals and objectives that are publicly disclosed will both provide transparency and show commitment towards properly modeling these developing countries. Data science, like most things, is simply a tool that has its own strengths and weaknesses. Due to that, it must be considered with all the other tools such as in-person surveys. Treating Data science in this way will allow researchers to create the most realistic model.
