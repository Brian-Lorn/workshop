# Final Individual Deliverable: Cambodia

## Political Subdivisions

The map above depicts the first administrative subdivisions of Cambodia known as provinces and the second administrative subdvisions which are known as districts. The dark gold outline delineates the international borders of Cambodia while the thinner, orange lines show the separation of the provinces. In addition, the bright gold lines differentiate the districts, so the lines become lighter and thinner as the administrative level decreases. Lastly, the black text represents the names of the provinces while the smaller, red text represents the districts. The map shows that most of the districts reside in the south. One reason for this is their proximity to the capital which necessitates the use of several subdivisions in order to properly represent the dense population. In total, the country of Cambodia spans roughly 180,000 square kilometers.

In terms of areas of focus, I chose to examine Phnom Penh and the Kampot district. In this instance, I refer to the autonomous municipality of Phnom Penh which is legally equivalent to a province, meaning it is classified as a first administrative subdivision. In addition, the municipality also contains the capital of Cambodia which is also named Phnom Penh. However, it should be noted that the Kampot district has been renamed to the Tuek Chhou district. 

## Population

The map above depicts the provinces of Cambodia by their population and density. Additionally, it also has a figure which shows how much each province represents in comparison to the total population within Cambodia. The gray outlines delineate between provinces and show the international border while the black text represents the names of the provinces. Note that the data used to create this model was collected in 2020 from WorldPop.

Looking at the map, it is clear that Phnom Penh, Siemréab, and Batdâmbâng have the highest populations. For Phnom Penh, this is expected because it is the capital of the country. Within Siemréab, there is a temple named Angkor Wat which is a popular tourist destination, meaning there is a lot of business in and around the area. Due to that, the region has an incredibly large population. Finally, for Batdâmbâng, the area is the leading rice-producing province and is an important trading center which connects Phnom Penh to Thailand. This explains why the population is incredibly dense along with the amount of districts seen clustered around it in the previous model.
