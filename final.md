# Final Individual Deliverable: Cambodia

## Political Subdivisions

![](cambodia.png)

The map above depicts the first administrative subdivisions of Cambodia known as provinces and the second administrative subdvisions which are known as districts. The dark gold outline delineates the international borders of Cambodia while the thinner, orange lines show the separation of the provinces. Lastly, the bright gold lines differentiate the districts, so the lines become lighter and thinner as the administrative level decreases. In addition, the black text represents the names of the provinces while the smaller, red text represents the districts. The map depicts that most of the distrcits reside in the south. One reason for this is their proximity to the capital which necessitates the use of several districts in order to properly represent the dense population. In total, the country of Cambodia spans roughly 180,000 square kilometers.

In terms of areas of focus, I chose to examine Phnom Penh and the Kampot district. In this instance, I refer to the autonomous municipality of Phnom Penh which is legally equivalent to a province, meaning it is classified as a first administrative subdivision. In addition, the municipality also contains the capital of Cambodia which is also named Phnom Penh. However, it should be noted that the Kampot district has been renamed to the Tuek Chhou district. 

## Population

The map above depicts the provinces of Cambodia by their population. The gray outlines delineate between provinces and show the international border while the black text represents the names of the provinces. Note that the data used to create this model was collected in 2020 from WorldPop.

Looking at the map, it is clear that Phnom Penh, Siemréab, and Batdâmbâng have the highest populations. For Phnom Penh, this is expected because it is the capital of the country. Within Siemréab, there is a temple named Angkor Wat which is a popular tourist destination, meaning there is a lot of business in and around the area. Due to that, the region has an incredibly large population. Finally, for Batdâmbâng, the area is the leading rice-producing province and is an important trading center which connects Phnom Penh to Thailand. This explains why the population is incredibly dense along with the amount of districts seen clustered around it in the previous model.

## Population & Density of Cambodia's Provinces

The following models represent the population and density of Cambodia's provinces along with how each province represents the total population within Cambodia. On the left, there is a map where gray outlines delineate between provinces while black text represents the names and density of each. The specific amount of population within each province is represented by some color on the gradient shown in the legend. To the right, a bar graph is used to show the provinces and the populations of each associated with them. Additionally, a percentage is also included which shows how much of the total population is located within that singular province.

I produced this by using the data associated with Cambodia and its provinces from WorldPop. Since the data for this region was relatively small, I did not need to use a pipe operator in order to specify my model to a specific first level subdivision.

Within the model, Phnom Penh is incredibly dense and populated. This is due to Phnom Penh being both the capital of Cambodia and one of the most urban areas within the entire region. This high population density can also be seen in how the neighboring provinces are also much smaller yet have some of the highest population densities of any province. This model also denotes that Batdâmbâng makes up nearly a tenth of the entire population of Cambodia which is due to it being a major trading hub that connects Thailand to Phnom Penh. Lastly, the third highest province in terms of population is Siemréab which can be explained by it being a popular tourist attraction with the temple of Angkor Wat.
