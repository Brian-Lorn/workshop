# Project 1: Cambodia

## Administrative Subdivisions of Cambodia

The following map depicts the first administrative subdivisions of Cambodia known as provinces and the second subdivisions which are districts. The dark gold outline delineates the international borders of Cambodia while the thinner, orange lines show the separation of the provinces. Lastly, the bright gold lines differentiate the districts, so the lines become lighter and thinner as the administrative level decreases. In addition, the black text represents the names of the provinces while the smaller, red text represents the districts.

One of the challenges I faced when creating this model was the non-uniform appearance of the districts. Looking at the model, most of the districts are centered around the capital Phnom Penh which makes it hard to read if the text size is too large. However, if I chose to make the text size much smaller, there would be a similar problem. In order to remedy this, I chose to change the text color to red in order to make it more legible and distinct from the name of the provinces.

After creating this model, I was intrigued as to why there were so many districts clustered around certain areas. After doing a bit of research, I was able to learn that the districts near the south are near the capital, necessitating several districts in order to properly represent the dense population. For the north west, there is a temple named Angkor Wat located in Siemréab. Due it being a popular tourist destination, there is a lot of business in and around the area which needs several districts in order to represent its dense population.

## Population of Cambodia's Provinces

The following map depicts the provinces of Cambodia by their population. The gray outlines delineate between provinces and show the international border while the black text represents the names of the provinces. As shown in the legend, the gradient of colors used directly correlates to the population of the province. Lastly, the data used to create this model was collected in 2020 from WorldPop.

One of the issues I faced while creating this model was making sure variable names stayed consistent and referred to the correct data. This was important because the coding matched population data with their respective provinces which could be incorrectly represented if the wrong variable name was used. In the process of creating this model, there were a few times where errors occurred and most of those were due to incorrect variable names. 

After creating this model, I noticed that, as expected, Phnom Penh and Siemréab both had high populations, yet the province next to Siemréab known as Batdâmbâng had a higher population which was approximately equivalent to the capital. Intrigued by this result, I began doing some research. It turns out that Batdâmbâng is the leading rice-producing province and is an important trading center which connects Phnom Penh to Thailand. This explains why the population is so incredibly dense along with the amount of districts seen in the previous model.

## Population & Density of Cambodia's Provinces

The following models represent the population and density of Cambodia's provinces along with how each province reprsents the total population within Cambodia. On the left, there is a map where gray outlines delineate between provinces while black text represents the names and density of each. The specific amount of population within each province is represented by some color on the gradient shown in the legend. To the right, a bargraph is used to show the provinces and the populations of each associated with them. Additionally, a percentage is also included which shows how much of the total population is located within that singular province.

I produced this by using the data associated with Cambodia and its provinces. Since the data for this region was relatively small, I did not need to use a pipe operator in order to specify my model to a specifc first level subdivision.
