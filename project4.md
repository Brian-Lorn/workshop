# Project 4: Kampot District

## Topography

![](kampot_district.png)

The figure above is a 3D model of the Kampot district which is a second level administrative division within Cambodia. The dashed yellow line delineates the border of the Kampot district while the solid orange line represents the primary roadways for the shaded areas. These gold, shaded areas are actually the urban areas of the region found through filtering population data by both minimum population and population density. Lastly, the dots denote health care services. Within the model, the blue dots denote a hospital, green dots signify pharmacies, and purple dots are all the other services. These other services are comprised of doctors, dentists, and clinics. However, it should be noted that the Kampot district has recently been renamed to the Tuek Chhou district.

Within the model, it can be seen that most of the western parts of the region are mountinous. Due to that, there is only one urban area found in the entire mountinous region since highly non-uniform terrain discourages large settlements. This is significant because 2/3 of the entire region is mountinous, meaning all of the other urban areas are located in the eastern region of the district. Looking at the model above, it is visibly apparent that one urban area is much larger than any other urban area. This is partly due to the topography which has limited the area where urban areas can occur, causing the probability that urban areas are built in close proximity to one another to greatly increase.

In terms of transportation facilities, there are few primary roadways that traverse the mountinous regions. This demonstrates how the moutinous region of the district has discouraged the construction of main roadways within the region, causing most of the transporation facilities to be built within the eastern region of the district. In addition, the roadways meet up within the district below which is a smaller but much more urbanized district.

Has producing your three-dimensional map resulted in an interpretion that is different from your previous analysis?
