# Project 4: Kampot District

## Topography

![](kampot_district.png)

The figure above is a 3D model of the Kampot district which is a second level administrative division within Cambodia. The dashed yellow line delineates the border of the Kampot district while the solid orange line represents the primary roadways for the shaded areas. These gold, shaded areas are actually the urban areas of the region found through filtering population data by both minimum population and population density. Lastly, the dots denote health care services. Within the model, the blue dots denote a hospital, green dots signify pharmacies, and purple dots are all the other services. These other services are comprised of doctors, dentists, and clinics. However, it should be noted that the Kampot district has recently been renamed to the Tuek Chhou district.

Within the model, it can be seen that most of the western parts of the region are mountinous. Due to that, there is only one urban area found in the entire mountinous region since highly non-uniform terrain discourages large settlements. This is significant because 2/3 of the entire region is mountinous, meaning all of the other urban areas are located in the eastern region of the district. Looking at the model above, it is visibly apparent that one urban area is much larger than any other urban area. This is partly due to the topography which has limited the area where urban areas can occur, causing the probability that urban areas are built in close proximity to one another to greatly increase.

In terms of transportation facilities, there are few primary roadways that traverse the mountinous regions. This demonstrates how the moutinous region of the district has discouraged the construction of main roadways, causing most of the transporation facilities to be built within the eastern region of the district. Since the primary roadways are clustered in the eastern region, there are far fewer total transporation facilities compared to an average district. Thus, the topography has forced most of the roadways to be secluded to the eastern region of the district along with decreasing the total amount of them constructed.

In general, health care facilities are usually located in densely populated areas in order to be accesible to the most people. However, the mountinous region discourages the formation of highly populated settlements, leading to few health care facilities being located in the entirety of that area. Because of this and the lack of primary roads, it makes it incredibly difficult for people in these regions to receive access to healthcare unless they are located in the eastern region of the district.

Before the creation of the model, I had speculated that most of the western region of the district had been rural areas, yet the creation of the model has clearly shown that it had been actually due to the mountinous topography. Additionally, this topographical data has helped in explaining why most of facilities had been secluded to the eastern region of the district.
